## Frontend Developer Challenge
 - Starting this project at 19/02 11:27 am
 - Its using React + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4.0

Sadly i had less than a day, soo i pretty much speedrun. However i did my best to make it as good as possible. I have a compromise on i wont be able to make last tasks.

Notes
 - Tables are not good on mobiles because it must infinitly scroll horizontally. Soo i made a Mobile version which fits pretty well.

Things accomplished:
 - A totally responsive and visually appealing UI on all pages.
 - Almost one to one from the figma design.
 - Copy wallet from Table with visual feedback
 - Dashboard on /dashboard or clicking perfil on the navbar
 - Sorters on the table
 - Pagination control
 - Filtering modal
 - Connect Wallet notify ( Currently this is only controlled by a state variable, but it can be easily changed to a real wallet connection )

 Navigation
  - Click on trader to see his profile
  - Click on the perfil on navbar to go to the dashboard
  - Click on the logo to go to the home page
